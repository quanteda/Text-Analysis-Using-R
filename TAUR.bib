	abstract = {During the last decade text mining has become a widely used discipline utilizing statistical and machine learning methods. We present the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tm&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; package which provides a framework for text mining applications within R. We give a survey on text mining facilities in R and explain how typical application tasks can be carried out using our framework. We present techniques for count-based analysis methods, text clustering, text classification and string kernels.},
