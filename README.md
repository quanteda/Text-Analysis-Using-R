This is the source code of the book in progress, *Text Analysis Using R*, by Kenneth Benoit and Stefan MÃ¼ller.

The draft HTML version of this book is published at https://quanteda.github.io/Text-Analysis-Using-R/. **However** we are not circulating this URL until we have a bit more content, at which stage we will also make the repository public.

## A companion R package

We have released a companion R package, TAUR, containing data and functions used in the book. You can install it using:

``` r
remotes::install_github("quanteda/TAUR")
```
