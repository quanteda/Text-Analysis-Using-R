# *Text Analysis Using R*

## Purpose

This is the source code of the book in progress, *Text Analysis Using R*, by Kenneth Benoit and Stefan MÃ¼ller.

The draft HTML version of this book is published at https://quanteda.github.io/Text-Analysis-Using-R/. **However** we are not circulating this URL until we have a bit more content, at which stage we will also make the repository public.

You are welcome to read and comment, and point out problems or make suggestions, using [issues](https://github.com/quanteda/Text-Analysis-Using-R/issues). You are even more welcome to edit the book yourself and submit the changes as a pull request. (Instructions for doing that can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).)

We will probably need a copyright transfer for anyone making a PR or filing an issue, something such as https://github.com/hadley/adv-r/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md, as well as a code of conduct for contributors.

## A companion R package

To contain data and some helper functions. Eventually.

``` r
remotes::install_github("quanteda/TAUR")
```

## Quarto

We're using the new [Quarto](https://quarto.org) framework for authoring this book. You can find full details as to how this works [here](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).
