# Building Feature Co-occurrence Matrices {#sec-quanteda-fcms}

## Objectives

In this chapter we explain the intuition behind feature co-occurrence matrices (fcm), when and why to use them, and how to construct an fcm from a **quanteda** tokens object. At the end of the chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of creating fcms and when and how they can use them.

## Methods

* Creating fcms
* Advanced options

## Examples

* Co-occurrence statistics
* Network analysis
* Computing word embeddings

## Issues

Additional issues.

## Further Reading

Additional resources from libraries or the web.
