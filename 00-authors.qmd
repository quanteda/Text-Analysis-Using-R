The *Quanteda Initiative* is a non-profit company we founded in 2018 in London, devoted to the promotion of open-source text analysis software. It supports active development of these tools, in addition to providing training materials, training events, and sponsoring workshops and conferences. Its main product is the open-source **quanteda** package for R, but the Quanteda Initiative also supports a family of independent but interrelated packages for providing additional functionality for natural language processing and document management.

Its core objectives, as stated in its charter, are to:

-   Support open-source, text analysis software developed for research and scientific analysis. These efforts focus mainly on the open-source software library quanteda, written for the R programming language, and its related family of extension packages.

-   Promote interoperability between text analytic software libraries, including those written in other languages such as Python, Java, or C++.

-   Provide ongoing user, technical, and development support for open-source text analysis software. Organize training and dissemination activities related to open-source text analysis software.
